This toolbox can be used to analyze tax depreciation schedules.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
List of functions in the Toolbox:
- "DB_depreciation": generates a declining-balance schedule 
- "SL_depreciation": generates a straight-line schedule
- "SL2_depreciation": generates a straight-line schedule with switch to another straight-line
- "DBSL_depreciation": generates a declining-balance schedule with switch to a straight-line schedule
- "initial_DB_depreciation": generates a schedule with a first year deduction followed by a declining-balance
- "HL_depreciation": computes the half-life of a given depreciation schedule
- "PDV_depreciation": computes the PDV of a given depreciation schedule
- "Approximating_depreciation_HL": approximates a depreciation schedule using the half-life
- "Approximating_depreciation_PDV": approximates a depreciation schedule using the PDV
